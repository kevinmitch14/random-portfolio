# Random Stock Portfolio
React app which allows users to enter a number of days, number of stocks and an initial investment. 
A random portfolio of S&P500 stocks is then created and the daily/cumulative returns are graphed.

The motivation for this was to see how much luck was involved in recent months to maintain positive returns.
Most if not all portfolios regardless of the stocks in it show great gains in the last year, in line with the S&P500.



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
